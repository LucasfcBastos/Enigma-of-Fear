                    <p>ENIGMA OF FEAR is an investigation and suspense game with detailed hostile environments full of mysteries. The game is made in pixel art and with 3D elements, with pixel art being used more for characters and 3D elements for items and scenarios. The game takes place within the perimeter, a specific region marked by an absurdly intense paranormal presence, featuring Spiral Castle, Cathedral, Cemetery of Melodies, and Strach Mansion.</p>

                    <p>Combat in this game is limited because it is a survival game, where all enemies can be lethal. Be sure to always stay close to your faithful friend, as terrifying creatures can damage your sanity and cause you to panic. Don't let fear get the better of you. In addition to the common enemies, there are six extremely challenging bosses in the game, which will require not only good preparation but also a good strategy to deal with these paranormal creatures.</p>

Not to mention that you will meet extremely memorable characters who can help you acquire new combat and investigation skills during your mission. On your journey, you will have the help of Samuel, a hacker who is part of the Order's Research Team, and Agatha, an occultist who assists with information about rituals and things related to the occult.</p>

                        <p>The Cult of Fear is a mysterious group, centuries old, that worshipped the “Mark of Fear.” This generational behavior was motivated by paranormal exposure to the symbol, an event that occurred hundreds of years ago.</p>
                        <p>This event was named when the oldest member had the revelation of the Prophecy of the Fearless. From that moment on, he became obsessed with the idea of provoking the Rise of the Fearless One and making him meet the God of Fear, through Fear itself, dedicating all his thoughts and actions to this purpose. Thus, he became the first leader of the cult and established a tradition that would be maintained by all generations of the Strach family.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the family lines, the practices were conducted by the most feared member,  Abraham Strach being the most recently recognized figure. After the event known as the “Rise of the Haunted,” all members of the Strach Family have a Vision, making them more obsessed and delusional with the concept of the “Mark of Fear,” triggering paranormal behaviors among them and giving rise to the various paranormal structures scattered throughout the Perimeter.</p>

                        <p>The Elite Team is a team from Ordo Realitas created with the aim of investigating the Perimeter, “a place that does not exist.” The members of this team are specialists in various fields, such as cryptology, psychoanalysis, mechanical engineering, nursing, geography, topography, among others. The leader of this team is Veríssimo, the leader of the Order.</p>
                        <p>As the Perimeter is divided into several areas, the team has split into sub-teams, each specializing in one of the areas of the site. For this reason, a secret base was built in the basement of Strach Mansion, with separate rooms to investigate each area and secret passages to the areas being investigated.</p>
                        <p>After a long time of 22 years, the leader of the Order decides to return to investigate the Perimeter, however, he is reported missing. Now you are Mia, his daughter, who decides to go to this “place that does not exist” in search of her father and to decipher the enigma of fear.</p>
